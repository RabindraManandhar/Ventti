      <h1>VENTTI CARD GAME</h1>
      <p>This is a desktop-version card game. It is one of my earliest projects,
        that I started to practice my basic JavaScript knowledge in the very
        beginning of my study in IT.</p>
      <p>This Ventti card game has a rule book and its rules are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>This game is played between two players - human(player1) and computer(player2)</li>
        <li>Player1 gets the first turn to draw the cards from a deck.</li>
        <li>Player2 gets his turn only after the player1 completes his turn to draw the cards.</li>
        <li>The winner is declared as follows:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>The player whose cards' sum exceeds 21 loses the game.</li>
            <li>The player whose cards' sum is most close to 21 wins the game.</li>
            <li>When player1 starts drawing cards, s/he can pass the turn to player2 at anytime.</li>
            <li>When player1 passes the turn to player2, the player2 starts the game and s/he can also
              stop his turn as will</li>
          </ol>
      </ol>
